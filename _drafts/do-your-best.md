Back in 2022 I took a three week solo trip to Japan. Like many, it was a country and a culture I admired and had always wanted to visit. As I planned, a few friends and family members offered or asked to go with me, but something in my gut told me it would be important to go alone. I learned a lot about myself, my motivations, and how I wished to move through the world during that trip. But one moment from those three weeks is burned into my memory and has become somewhat of a mantra for me.

After a week in Tokyo, I had planned to take the train to Kyoto, but the night before I decided to change plans and spend a day in Hiroshima before heading to Kyoto (with a pit stop to Naoshima). I quickly realized how easy it was to travel in Japan, especially alone, so calling audibles like this became a common theme of the trip.

I reached Hiroshima on July 4th, 2022.

After dropping my bags at the hotel, I headed straight to the Hiroshima Peace Museum. When I entered the first gallery, I observed a pile of children's shoes - small, burned, and blackened. At that moment I told myself I would read every word in the museum that I could. It felt too important not to.

I read many stories that made my eyes well up and occasionally had to stop to sit and weep. 

But one has stuck with me more than any other.

I read the last diary entry of a 13-year-old girl named Tamiko. In it she shared how she had given her little brother a bath, which he loved because she would let him splash in the water. Afterwards, her parents asked her season the Udon for dinner, which they remarked was good. The last line of her entry simply read, "*If you do your best, anything can be interesting*, I thought."

I left the room and cried for a few minutes. I was immediately struck by the infinite possibilities of the human experience and devastated knowing that all of her possibilities ended the very next day. And yet, her optimism, introspection, and humility in that one phrase have given me more comfort in the last three years than anything I've heard since. 

So do your best and make something interesting, for all of those who cannot.
