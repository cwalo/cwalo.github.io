Back in 2022 I took a three week solo trip to Japan. Like many, it was a country and a culture I admired and had always wanted to visit. As I planned, a few friends and family members offered or asked to go with me, but something in my gut told me it would be important to go alone. I'd been laid off, was debating what my next steps would be, and felt that I needed a proper quest to help reset. Thrown into the most foreign place I'd ever visited, I learned a lot about myself, my motivations, and how I wished to move through the world. But one moment from those three weeks is burned into my memory and has become somewhat of a mantra for me.

After a week in Tokyo, I had planned to take the train to Kyoto, but the night before I decided to change plans and spend a day in Hiroshima before heading to Kyoto. I quickly realized how easy it was to travel in Japan, so altering my plans, unencumbered by the company of anyone but myself, became a common theme of the trip.

I reached Hiroshima on July 4th, 2022.

After dropping my bags at the hotel, I headed straight to the Hiroshima Peace Museum. When I entered the first gallery, I observed a pile of children's shoes - small, burned, and blackened. At that moment I told myself I would read every word in the museum that I could. It felt too important not to.

I read many stories that made my eyes well up and occasionally had to stop to sit and weep. 

But one has stuck with me more than any other.

I read the last diary entry of a 13-year-old girl named Tamiko. In it she shared how she had given her little brother a bath, which he loved because she would let him splash in the water. Afterwards, her parents asked her to season the Udon for dinner, which they remarked was good. The last line of her entry simply read, "*If you do your best, anything can be interesting*, I thought."

In that moment, I was immediately struck by the infinite possibilities of the human experience and devastated knowing that all of her possibilities, and those of her friends and neighbors, ended the very next day. And yet, her optimism, introspection, and humility in that one phrase have given me more comfort in the last three years than anything I've heard since. 

So these days, I just do my best and hope for&mdash;nothing perfect&mdash;something *interesting*.
